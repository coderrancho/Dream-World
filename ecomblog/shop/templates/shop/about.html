        <h1>Dream World</h1>
        <p>Dream World is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The company initially focused on online stationary sales required for kids before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and domestic rival Snapdeal. As of March 2017, Dream World held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry. Dream World has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones. Dream World also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface.

In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Dream World for US$16 billion, valuing Dream World at around $20 billion.</p>
